### Obsolete warning

The library was an experiment for providing a cross-platform multiplatform IO primitives
and its development and maintenance was effectively postponed in 2019.

Its current API is frozen at version 0.1.16 and won't receive any further API updates, 
improvements or bugfixes.

### Future replacement

Future replacement is to be discussed, currently we do recomment using [Okio](https://github.com/square/okio/)
for multiplatform IO primitives.
